# SnpEpiMap
SnpEpiMap is a pipeline for understanding the epigenomic landscape of crucial genomic variants in different tissues.
SnpEpiMap (version 1.0.0) takes the significant genomic variants as input and generates heatmaps of epigenetic signals from different tissues for downstream analysis. SnpEpiMap has three main functions.
1. annotate SNPs identified by GWAS or other meta-genomics studies.
2. collect related datasets from the Roadmap database and query the epigenetic signals by Deepblue (https://deepblue.mpi-inf.mpg.de/). 
3. compute metrics (i.e., signal values, number of peaks, peak locations) and plot heatmaps.
